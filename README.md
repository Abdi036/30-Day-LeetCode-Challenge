# 30-Day LeetCode Challenge 🧑‍💻🚀

Welcome to the **30-Day LeetCode Challenge**! 🎉

This challenge is designed to help you **sharpen your problem-solving skills**, build consistency in coding, and prepare for coding interviews. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this challenge is for you!

## 🏆 How It Works

- For the next **30 days**, you will solve one LeetCode problem each day.
- Each day’s solution should be submitted as a Python file named `dayXX.py`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `day01.py`, `day02.py`, etc.).
- You’ll track your progress, compete with others, and improve your coding skills throughout the challenge.
  
By the end of this challenge, you’ll have a solid set of solutions and a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures.

- **Duration:** 30 Days

### Key Goals:
- **Sharpen algorithm skills**
- **Build consistency in coding**
- **Crack coding interviews**

## 📝 Submission Guidelines

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a folder** inside the `solutions/` directory using your **GitHub username**.
   - Example: `solutions/john_doe/`
3. For each day of the challenge, create a Python file named `dayXX.py`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `day01.py`, `day02.py`, etc.).
4. **Submit your solutions as a Pull Request (PR)** every time you complete a day's problem. The PR should include:
   - The file(s) for each completed day (e.g., `day01.py`, `day02.py`).
   - **Do not submit duplicate files** for the same day (overwrite previous files if necessary).

## 🔥 Leaderboard

The leaderboard is updated automatically every time a pull request is merged into the main branch. Check out the **[LEADERBOARD.md](LEADERBOARD.md)** to see how you rank compared to others.

### How the leaderboard works:
- The leaderboard is updated based on the number of **unique days** you've completed. Each day is counted once, and you must submit a valid solution for each day.
- If you submit multiple solutions for the same day, only the most recent solution will count.

## 📈 Track Your Progress

You can track your progress in the **[progress.json](progress.json)** file, which gets updated automatically. This file will tell you how many days you've completed and when you last updated your solutions.

## ⚙️ How to Get Started

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/30-Day-LeetCode-Challenge.git

3. Create a new directory for your solutions:
   ```bash
   mkdir solutions/yourusername
4. Start solving LeetCode problems and add your solutions in files named day01.py, day02.py, etc.
5. After solving each day's problem, commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add solutions/yourusername/dayXX.py
   git commit -m "Day XX: Problem title or brief description"
   git push origin main

6. Submit a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes into the main repository.
